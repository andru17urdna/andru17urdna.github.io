## Welcome to My GitHub Page

You must be at least a little interested in me if you're reading this. SO,
I'll tell you a little bit about myself. For the past decade I've been a custom fabricator ,both running jobs as well as building myself. It was hard work but it was what helped to build the mindset that I have today.


I have a few rules that I like to fall back on when I'm creating anything, whether it's coding or building, these rules help to guide me:
1. If you're already building it, make it stand out.
2. Treat everything you create as if your name is on it.
3. True quality can be found in the small details. People easily forget the larger picture but will always remember the attention to the littles things.


I believe if you were to take a look at my projects you will find these rules applied on every single page.
